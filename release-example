# You can create releases by pushing release metafiles with Git.
# You can use this file as a template for release metafiles.

# You can also remove releases by deleting the corresponding
# release metafiles from your repository, so be careful.

# The release metafiles have to be saved in 'releases' folder in
# the metafiles branch with the version as filename. For example,
# if you save this file as 'releases/1.0' a release called 'My App'
# would have the version '1.0'.

# The scm_tag is the hash of the commit that will be released.
